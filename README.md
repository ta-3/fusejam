### Summary

I participated in the Bristol-based Fuse Jam, a 48-hour game jam which ran from October 4th to October 6th 2019. During this period I worked in a team of 5 to create the following application, which we named 'Tidal Loch'. I was one of two programmers, alongside two sound designers/musicians and a 3d artist. Over the jam I was responsible for the boat physics, game logic, and helping to integrate the work of other team members into the project. I also participated in the team’s collaborative work in design, testing, and presentation.
